WHAT IS FLEX IRC CLIENT
==========================
Flex IRC Client is a example IRC Client in Flex/Flash.
It uses the FIRC IRC Library for Flex. This client is not (currently)
intended to be a full-featured IRC client. It merely serves to highlight
some of the features and uses of the FIRC library.
	 
WHY SHOULD I USE FLEX IRC CLIENT?
==========================
If you plan to develop a flash/flex-based application that needs to 
access an IRC network this might be a good starting point. The most common 
features of a chat client are implemented as well as a console screen to show 
server output. 


INSTALLATION
============
To try out the Client just fire up the swf in a browser of flash player.  

To try out the code you have 2 options:

1) Create a new Flex project and copy the mxml,css and com.oosterwijk.irc.* into it
   Make sure also to reference either the Firc.swc of the Firc project
2) checkout the Firc and Flex IRC Client projects from subversion.
