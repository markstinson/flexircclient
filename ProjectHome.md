Flex IRC Client aims to be a Flex / Flash based IRC Client. Currently most browser-based chat solutions are either proprietary or applets. Flex IRC Client wants to bring the power of IRC to the majority of the Internet-users without requiring a download or an install.

This project is a port of the Java-based PircBot to ActionScript 3/Flex. This project distributes 2 files:
  * the actual IRC client (flexircclient)
  * the IRC protocol library (firc)

The client can be used without downloading the library but if you want to develop and recompile the client you will need the library.

At the moment the client is useable but it still needs some polish.

Enjoy.
