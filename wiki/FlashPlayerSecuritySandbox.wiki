#security sandbox violation explanation.

= Introduction =

If you try to access an IRC server from the flexircclient loaded over http from a server in a different domain you might get a "Security sandbox violation". Flash Player was designed with a strong security model and it disallows you from making contact with a server that is not the original source of the SWF. 


= Details =
By default Flash Player will not allow a SWF loaded from one domain to access data on a different domain. There are a couple of options to work around this:

  # Load the SWF from your local file system. (not over http) This way you have full access to access any domain
  # Put the SWF on the domain to which you're trying to connect (this is probably not feasible if you are connecting to a third party server)
  # Ask the operator of IRC server to place a crossdomain.xml file on the IRC server 
  # Use a proxy on your web server which will connect to the IRC server on behalf of the Flash client
